# Explanations by Discussion
I recently discovered the following type of explanation in which there's a
dialog between two characters trying to solve a problem. They start at the most
naive or basic solution to a problem, and then iterate on that design until they
end up with something fairly complex.

I find these types of explanations very useful and wanted to collect and create
more.

Here are a few that already exist:
- [Kerberos - Distributed
Authentication](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dialogue.html)
- [Web
Security](http://blog.slaks.net/2015-10-13/web-authentication-arms-race-a-tale-of-two-security-experts/)

Feel free to submit PRs with new content!
